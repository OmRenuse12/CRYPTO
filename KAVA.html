<h2>What Is Kava (KAVA)?</h2>
<p>Kava is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. 

    The Kava Network uses a developer-optimized co-chain architecture. The Ethereum Co-Chain enables support for EVM smart contracts while the Cosmos Co-Chain enables the lightning-fast Tendermint consensus engine and the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). 
    
    The two co-chains are connected by a translator module that enables them to interoperate seamlessly, bringing the two most used blockchain development environments together in a single, scalable network.
    
    The Kava Network features a native governance and utility token, KAVA, that can be staked by validators or delegated to validator nodes. Stakers and delegators earn 37.5% of all KAVA emissions as a reward for securing the network. Kava stakers also have voting rights in network governance proposals.
<h2>What Makes Kava Unique?</h2>
<p>The Kava Network utilizes a developer-optimized co-chain architecture that delivers the development power of Ethereum with the speed, interoperability, and low transaction fees of Cosmos in a single network.

    The Kava Network empowers developers with:
    
    Flexible Deployment: Developers can build and deploy on either of the two most used permissionless execution environments in the world using the EVM-compatible Ethereum Co-Chain or the Cosmos Co-Chain.
    
    On-Chain Incentives: A transparent and decentralized on-chain incentive model ensures that the best developers and projects in every Web3 vertical (including DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs) are rewarded for their contributions with a proportional share of the value and governance of the network.
    
    Seamless Interoperability: Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts that interoperate seamlessly with Cosmos SDK protocols in the same network, connecting their project to every major asset and millions of users.</p>
</p>
<h2>How Is the Kava Network Secured?</h2>
<p>Kava is built on Cosmos and uses a Tendermint-based proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity of the network.

    The Kava Network uses a network of validator nodes for confirming transactions. These validator nodes must put up collateral to take up the duty of validating transactions. If validators misbehave or fail to meet rigorous minimum requirements, their stake will be penalized — thereby incentivizing validators to remain honest and efficient.
    
    Kava holders can run a staking node to earn KAVA rewards directly from the protocol. However, only the top 100 Kava nodes (also known as validators) are eligible to receive these rewards. Beyond this, KAVA holders can stake their tokens on various compatible exchange platforms, like Binance, Kraken, Huobi Pool, and in wallets like Trust Wallet, Cosmostation Wallet, and Keplr.
    
    Multiple independent blockchains and crypto security firms have audited Kava’s smart contracts, including CertiK, B-Harvest, and Quantstamp. To date, no vulnerabilities have been found.</p><br>
