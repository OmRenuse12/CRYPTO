<h2>What is Lido Staked Ether?</h2>
<p>Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.

    While the price of stETH to ETH is based on the market demand, stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the token’s balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards. At this moment, stETH price can deviate from 1 ETH as it is currently not possible to claim the underlying ETH until Ethereum 2.0 fully merges. stETH tokens can be used as one would use ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e.g. yields across decentralised finance products.
    
    As of June 11, 2022, 1 stETH is worth 0.955 ETH due to liquidity issue and supposed additional risks due to the delay of the merge alongside with DAO/smart contract risks.
